- Go code are organised as packages
- Packages are a collection of source files the same directory that are compiled together. 
	- Functions, types, variables and constants defined in one source are accessible across all other source files in the same package
- A repository consists of one or more modules
	- A module is a collection of related Go packages that are released together. 
		- A repository usually consists of only one module, located at the root of the repository. 
		- A file named go.mod declares the module path, which is the import path prefix for all the packages within that module.
- An import path is a string used to import a package.
	- An import path is its module path joined with its subdirectory within the module.
	- Packages in the standard library do not have a module path prefix
