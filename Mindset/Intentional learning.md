 * While need to learn is the fundamental or the underlying aspect, the learning process in itself is not a "burden" or "effort" for intentional learners.
 * It is an investment we make in ourselves.
 * Intentional learning can be spontaneous but its also deliberate.
 * Intentional learners often engage in the following actions as part of the learning process:
	 * Questioning things
	 * Organising new knowledge and ideas into useful system of facts, concepts and principles that can be used while also enhancing the understanding of what they've just learned
	 * Connecting new and old knowledge into broad patterns of understanding.
	 * Adapting to new situations and needs.
* Two core mindsets needed to become an intentional learner:
	* [[Growth mindset]]
	* [[Being curious]]
* After you've got the mindset sorted out, you still need to do a very important thing to make intentional learning a habit - practice. These are the 5 core skills you need to practice to become an intentional learner:
	* [[Goal setting]]
	* [[Remove distractions]]
	* [[Feedback loops]]
	* [[Deliberate practice]]
