* A fixed mindset is the belief that personality characteristics, talents and abilities are finite or fixed resources.
* People with this mindset tend to take a polar view of themselves - they are either successful or a failure, talented or untalented, etc
* This mindset hinders learning
* Growth mindset however is the opposite of fixed mindset. It suggests that you continue to grow, expand, evolve and change and that intelligence, capabilities and skills are not something that is fixed (that you are born with, for example) but something that can be cultivated
* It frees you from the expectation of being perfect. You see failures and mistakes as not limits of your intellect but rather tools or opportunities that help you develop.
* A growth mindset allows you to find value, joy and success in the process, regardless of the outcome. 
* Developing a growth mindset begins with confronting your fears. It begins with moving out of your comfort zone. And that starts from inner dialogue. You need to shift dialogue from the belief about your ability to belief about your opportunities and needs.
	* For example, you might be having stage fear. The right inner dialogue should be about you wanting more opportunities to confront/eliminate your stage fear rather than shying away from opportunities because you have stage fear
