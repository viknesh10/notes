- A good stock to SIP in will have:
	- High Industry growth rate
	- The firm should be building its market share
		- A relatively new industry like AMC for example
	- It should be able to protect its margins
		- Via higher pricing, cost cutting, launching newer products etc
- If all of the above happens, its more ideal
- Industries/Sectors which can be SIPed in:
	- Small Caps
	- AMCs
	- NBFC Small Caps
	- US Tech majors
- Keep emotions aside
- Keep tracking individual stocks in your SIP watchlist
- Strategy to pump money per month in a stock:
	- Have a monthly budget - Example 30k
	- Deploy only when NIFTY falls
		- If it doesnt fall by 15th of a month, deploy half of the budget (15k)
		- If it doesnt fall by 30th, deploy remaining
- Step-up SIP
	- When markets/stock is about to go up and when there is a scope for a growth of 20%+
- Step-down SIP
	- When the market is taking a breather and about to consolidate
- Normal SIP
	- When markets are in a consolidation phase
- Bulk buy
	- When something is at a massive discount
