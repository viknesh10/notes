- There are 6 stages to Financial Freedom
	- Dependence
		- Starts from childhood, extends into adulthood
		- As soon as our income surpasses our expenditure, we move to the next stage
	- Solvency
		- Being able to cover your financial obligations independently
		- The real beginning of your financial journey
	- Stability
		- Its achieved when you have
			- Built an emergency fund
			- Paid off high interest debt
			- Been consistently living within your means
		- During this stage, you're not just managing your expenses, you are preparing yourself for the unexpected
		- During this stage, you are also laying the groundwork for a secure financial future
		- Debt is still okay at this stage, but having a buffer (an emergency fund) will provide you with a peace of mind
		- You should not be spiralling into debt during a financial crisis
		- Continuing to stay disciplined and make wise financial decisions at this stage will enable to build a solid financial foundation and move closer to Financial Freedom
	- Security
		- This is the stage where your stability transitions to confidence and peace of mind.
