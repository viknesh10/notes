* Learning takes hold (or "sticks" with you) only when there is a clear goal towards which you are working
* Consider these best practices:
	* Set a goal that matters to you
	* Make the goal concrete
	* Adopt a 'once in a career' mindset
		* This helps you extract the maximum out of challenging aspects rather than letting unique opportunities go.
