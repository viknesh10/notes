* Wanted to keep a track of the steps needed while creating a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) in India.
    * Come up with a name
        * Needs to be unique and not clash with existing trademarks. If it does, you might need to get a NOC from the concerned person/organisation who has registered the said trademark - its a messy, legal process so best we stick to s unique, fresh name
    * Come up with a description for your company
        * The mission statement is needed while registering the company so the earlier you prepare this, the better. 
        * Another task is to figure out where you'll be providing your services in - IT, hospitality etc. You can select upto three sectors (three NIC codes) so make sure your overlap is within the said sectors
    * RUN application
        * This is done on the MCA portal - RUN stands for Reserve Unique Name. Pretty self explanatory
        * Once(If) this is successful, you have 3 months before which you need to incorporate your LLP. If you fail to do so, the process has to be started again as the name will be "released"
    * DSC
        * In parallel, you need to register for a digital signature (if you are going to be a director - which is almost always) which is needed for a lot of aspects of your company
    * Incorporation
        * Once the RUN is successful, you are ready to incorporate your LLP. The process takes upto a week or 10 (working) days
        * Make sure you have your documentations in place - company address, director details, etc
    * DIN/PAN/TAN
        * Once the incorporation is done, you will be provided with an incorporation letter, PAN and TAN of the company. The same will be mailed to you
    * GST
        * Its recommended to get your GST done so that you can file your GST once your turnover crosses 40LPA
        * Its not needed to file GST if you fall below the said threshold
    * Hire a good CA
        * This is purely optional but again, recommended. You can automate your tax filings, GST filings etc to the said CA and just focus on your business
    * MSME
    * Bank Account
        * In order to start a bank account (current/savings), GST or MSME number is mandatory.
