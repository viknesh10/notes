#### Graph
- A graph G = (V, E) is a set of vertices V and edges E where each edge (u, v) is a connection between vertices
#### Neighbours
- Vertices u and v are neighbours if an edge (u, v) connects them
#### Degree
- A degree(v) is equal to the number of edges connected to v.
	- Also known as number of neighbours connected to v
#### Path
- Sequence of vertices connected by edges
- Path length - number of edges in a path
#### Cycle
- A path that starts and ends with the same vertex
- All cycles are paths but not all paths are cycles
#### Connectivity
- Two vertices are connected if a path exists between them
- A graph is connected when all vertices are connected
#### Connected Component
- A subset of vertices that is connected
