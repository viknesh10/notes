- Each container starts from the image definition each time it starts
- While containers can create, update and delete files, those changes are lost when you remove the container and Docker isolates all changes to that container.
- This also includes data loss every time. However, thats where Docker Volumes come in.
- Use a volume for persistent data:
    - Create the volume
    - Create your container
- Mounted to a directory in the container
- Data is written to the volume
- Deleting a container doesn't delete a volume
- First-class citizens
- Uses the local driver
- Third party drivers
    - Block storage
    - File storage
    - Object storage
