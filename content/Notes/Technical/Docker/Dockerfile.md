- Dockerfiles are instructions on how to build an image
- The file contains all commands used to start a container:
    - Docker image consists of read-only layers
    - Each layer represents a Dockerfile instruction
    - Layers are stacked
    - Each layer is a delta of the changes from the previous layer
    - Images are built using the docker image build command (with necessary flags)
- General guidelines:
    - Keep containers as ephemeral as possible
    - Avoid including unnecessary files
        - Use .dockerignore
    - Use multi-stage builds to reduce the size of image size
        - Dont include unnecessary packages
        - Minimize the number of layers
    - Decouple applications
    - Sort multi-line arguments
    - Leverage the build cache
