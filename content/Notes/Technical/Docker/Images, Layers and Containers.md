- Docker Images:
    - Templates for containers - used to create an instance of a container
    - Comprised of multiple layers
    - They are build time constructs while containers are run time constructs
    - An image cannot be deleted until all containers using that image have been deleted
    - Built from instructions (Dockerfile)
- Layers:
    - Images are made of multiple layers
    - Each layer represents an instruction in the imageâ€™s Dockerfile
    - Each layer, except the very last one, is read-only
    - Each layer is only a set of differences from the layer before it
    - Containers add a new writable layer on top of the underlying layers
    - All changes made to a running container are made to the container layer
- Container and Layers:
    - Containers are the top level writable layer
    - All changes made are stored in the writable layer
    - The writable layer is deleted when the container is deleted
    - The image remains unchanged even after the container is deleted
