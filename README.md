Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am Viknesh Subramanian and this is my Digital Garden.
I want to use this space to share and grow my thoughts on topics that interest me. I hope you find this interesting as much as I do.

I am a FullStack Software Engineer (specialising in .NET) by profession with over 9 years of experience in the field with an inclination towards Backend development.

However, I don't want my profession to be my sole identity (I swear the domain has nothing to do with my primary skill set ðŸ˜‡) and thats one of the major reasons of me starting this space to explore my interests further and also learn new stuff.

**Work in progress**
This space is forever intended to be a work in progress so a lot of notes/seeds will move around. In due course I'll update these sections to add more detail but I want to give a note of thanks to my brother-in-law [Thiruppathi Muthukumar](https://thiru.xyz/) for introducing me into the world of Process Knowledge Management a couple of years back when I called him to rant about my frequent forgetfulness when it came to his book suggestions.
